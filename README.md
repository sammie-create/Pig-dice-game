#Pig Dice Game üé≤

A fun and interactive dice game where two players compete to be the first to reach 100 points!
How to Play

    Starting the Game:
        Player 1 begins by rolling the dice.

    Rolling the Dice:
        If the dice roll is 1, Player 1 loses all points accumulated in the current round, and it's Player 2's turn.
        If the dice roll is not 1, the rolled number is added to Player 1‚Äôs current score.

    Accumulating Points:
        Player 1 can continue rolling the dice to accumulate points for the current round.
        However, if Player 1 rolls a 1, all points for that round are lost, and the turn passes to Player 2.

    Switching Turns:
        Player 2 rolls the dice and follows the same rules as Player 1.

    Winning the Game:
        The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.
